# level 06

In the unix systems, the password hash is stored in the file /etc/passwd.

```bash
cat /etc/passwd | grep flag06
```

now we need a script that can crack the hash, to do so we use python. We could
use other tools like john to do the same thing.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import crypt
import sys

hash = sys.argv[2]
with open(sys.argv[1]) as f:
    for line in f:
        if hash == crypt.crypt(line.rstrip(), "ue"):
            print "Password: %s" % line
            break
```

In this case I used a word list found on internet

```bash
wget https://download.openwall.net/pub/wordlists/all.gz
gzip -d all.gz
chmod +x /home/level06/crack.py
/home/level06/crack.py all ueqwOCnSGdsuM
```

Now we can use as password for falg06 "hello" and run getflag.
