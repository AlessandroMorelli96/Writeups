# level14

In this level we need to understand how the 'flag14' executable is encrypting
the string we give to input to decrypt the content of the file token.

After some test we understand that the program take the char in input convert it
in int than sum it with is position, starting from 0, and than reconvert it to
char and print it.

```text
1111
1234

1234
1357
```

```python
import sys

res = []

for i, l in enumerate(sys.argv[1]):
    j = ord(l)
    j -= i
    res.append(car(j))

print(''.join(res))
```

Now as always we log as flag14 and run getflag.
