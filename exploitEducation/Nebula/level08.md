# level 08

We need to download in our machine the "/home/flag08/capture.pcap" file, to do
so we use scp.

Then we can open the file using Wireshark, with follow TCP we see that there is
an attempt of login with "backd00Rmate" (the . are the rapresentation of 0x7f,
which is the hex of del)as password. We use it to login as flag08 and run "getflag".
