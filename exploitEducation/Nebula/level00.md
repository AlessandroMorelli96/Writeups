# Level 00

We need to find the program that run as flag00.

```bash
find / -perm -4000 -user flag00 2>/dev/null
```

* perm specify what permission bit should at least be set, in our case we know
that the user has the permission of execution so we set '4000'.
* user specify the username of the user that the files should belong.

From the output we find '/bin/.../flag00', to run it we just need to:

```bash
/bin/.../flag00
```

Now as the program say run:

```bash
getflag
```
